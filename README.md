#Graphing __atop__ metrics in grafana/influxdb

Just simple way to create graphics from atop metrics. 
Updated to use images based on Ubuntu 22.04 and current versions of atop, Grafana and InfluxDB. 

Now it works for:

- __CPU__ information
- __cpu__ infirmation per core
- __CPL__ CPU load statistic
- __MEM__ Memory usage statistics
- __SWP__ swapping statistics
- __PAG__ paging statistics
- __LVM/MDD/DSK__ disk subsystem statistics
- __NET__ network statistics per interface and upper level

__NOT__ working for process-level statistics:

- "PRG" (general),
- "PRC" (cpu),
- "PRM" (memory),
- "PRD" (disk, only if the kernel-patch has been installed)
- "PRN" (network, only if the kernel-patch has been installed).

## General workflow

###What we have to do:

1. Export necessary metrics from atop binary logs
1. Convert data to the format for export by InfluxDB
1. Push data to the InfluxDB
1. have a graphics in graphana

###How we can do that:

####1. build containers.

Assume you have docker installed. Let's checkout repo

```
# git clone git@github.com:aplsms/atop-graph.git
Cloning into 'atop-graph'...
Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '192.30.253.113' to the list of known hosts.
remote: Counting objects: 65, done.
remote: Total 65 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 65

Resolving deltas: 100% (19/19), done.

```

We are ready to build containers

```
# cd atop-graph
# ./build
Error response from daemon: No such container: atop-convert_con
Can't delete container atop-convert_con

```

please ignore "Errors" -- just attempt to remove nonexistant containers

####2. convert the logs

Copy all your logs to ./src directory, and convert it.

```
# find ./src  -type f
./src/D1/dsvtxvcdbng01_atop_20160705
./src/D1/dsvtxvcdbng01_atop_20160706

[Some lines skipped ...]

./src/D2/dsvtxvCkstn02_atop_20160706
./src/D2/dsvtxvCkstn02_atop_20160707
# ./convert

atop-converter
```

####3. starting grafana and pushing data to InfluxDB

```
# ./start_grafana
Error response from daemon: No such container: grafana-influxdb_con

```

####4. Login to grafana, and cgoose proper dashboard and timeframe

In a browser go to  `http://<docker-ip>:3000/`. Login: `admin`, Password: `admin`
